# Netlify Function - Docusign Webhook

If you want your own copy to play around with, the quickest way to get it up
and running is clicking the Deploy to Netlify button below. It will clone
this repository into your own account, and deploy the site to Netlify.

## Setup ðŸ› 

To run the examples locally, hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need:

**System Requirements:**

* [git](https://git-scm.com)
* [NodeJS](nodejs.org) 8 or greater
* [yarn](yarnpkg.com)

`cd` into your local copy of the repository and run `yarn` or `npm install`

```
cd docusign-webhook-netlify-lambda
yarn
```

## Running ðŸ”¥

```
yarn start
```

This will start the netlify-lambda server on http://localhost:8080/.netlify/functions/docusign_webhook.

[netlify-lambda](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-lambda) isnâ€™t required to deploy Lambda functions to Netlify, but it offers some handy features out of the box that make it quicker to get started, like the local dev server and nice defaults for transpiling and bundling functions in production.

The client server is configured to proxy `/.netlify` requests to the Lambda server (see [webpack.client.js](webpack.client.js)). This is the same behavior the site has when itâ€™s deployed to Netlify.
